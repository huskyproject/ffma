"Translation" of this "manual" by Ingo Korb.
------------------------------------------------------------------
General
------------------------------------------------------------------

This text is just a short help. 
A real documentation might be written later (no, really!).

This is an BETA version of FFMA. Although I have tested FFMA some errors 
might remain. 

Please send a bug report if you find one. See also the file BUG-REPORTING.

When FFMA is started for the first time the parameter SAVEUID might be
neccecary so stop FFMA from filtering the old messages. The parameter is also
neccecary if you used SqFix.

FFMA only works with Squish and .MSG message bases and is currently for 
netmail only (save for ECHOCOPY/ECHOMOVE).

FFMA was written in Pascal. 
To compile it you need FPC-Pascal: http://www.freepascal.org

FFMA was tested only on Linux to this date.

After changing the config file you should run ffma CHECK to test it. 
In this mode FFMA does not execute any actions.

Action-Statements
------------------------------------------------------------------

about the Syntax
================
MB:(..)	Specifies a message base
			MB: Linux.ger
	The other information will be read using fidoconfig.

ADDR:(..)	Specifies an address
			ADDR:75:7158/854.69

F:(..)	Specifies a file
			Linux: F:/var/spool/fido/bouncetext

SEENBY:(..)	Specifies SEEN-BY
		SEENBY:2448/820

DO:(..)	Specifies a "MASK" that is run on the message that
	was just created.

D:(..)   Specifies a directory.

Anything in square brackets ([]) is optional.

echocopy MB:(..) ADDR:(..) SEENBY:(..) [DO:(..)]
------------------------------------------------
Copies a net mail into an echo area.
- all kludges are deleted
- the local flag is set, all others are deleted
- ADDR is set as the From address
- Tearline (---) gets replaced by -+- if found
- Origin ( * Origin:) gets replaced by + Origin: if found
- new tearline and origin are appended
- the mask specified by DO:(..) will be run on the new
  message (Warning: Echomail!)

echomove MB:(..) ADDR:(..) SEENBY:(..) [DO:(..)]
------------------------------------------------
Same as echocopy, but deletes the original message.

bounce ADDR:(..) F:(..) [FULLMSG] [MB:(..)] [DO:(..)]
-----------------------------------------------------
Send a netmail back to the author.
- The message starts with the text from the file specified by
  F:(..). If FULLMSG is used the original message is appended
  to this text.
  In the file you can use these tokens:
    %FR  Name of the sender
    %OR  Address of the sender
    %TO  Name of the recipient
    %DE  Address of the recipient
    %SU  Subject
    %TI  Time in hh:mm:ss format
    %DA  Date in dd:mm:yyyy format
- REPLYTO/REPLYADDR-kludges are not supported yet
- the from-field is set to FFMA
- the local-flag is set, all other flags are deleted
- all kludges are deleted
- If MB:(..) is specified the bounce-message is put into a
  different netmail-area.
- The mask specified by DO:(..) is run on the new message.
- The original message will not be deleted. Use action del
  if you need to.

copy MB:(..) [DO:(..)]
----------------------
Copies a netmail into a different netmail-area
- The message will not be changed in any way.
- The mask specified by DO:(..) is run on the new message.

move MB:(..) [DO:(..)]
----------------------
Moves a netmail into a different netmail-area.
- The message will not be changed in any way.

ExportHeader F:(..) | D:(..)
----------------------------
Writes the header of a netmail into the file specified by F:(..) or creates 
unique File in the directory specified by D:(..). 

ExportMSG F:(..)
----------------
Writes the header any body of a netmail into the file specified by F:(..) or
creates unique File in the directory specified by D:(..). 

Del
---
Deletes a netmail.
- All actions following a del-action will be ignored.

SEMAPHORE F:(..)
----------------
Creates a semaphore.
- If the file specified by F:(..) does not exist it will be
  created.
- If the file specified by F:(..) already exists it's timestamp
  will be set to the current time.

REWRITE FROM=(..) | TO=(..) | SUBJ=(..) | DEST=(..) | ORIG=(..)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Changes the sender, the recipient or the subject.


------------------------------------------------------------------
Search
------------------------------------------------------------------

search=none
	This condition will never be true. Only useful for DO-Statements.

search=any
	This condition is always true.

| logical OR
& logical AND

Example:
	search from="someone" | from="someoneelse"
	search (from="someone & to="myname") | (from="someoneelse")
[Translators note: Error: String constant exceeds line. =) ]

search from="~peter"	Searches for messages where peter appears
					somewhere in the name.
search from="!~peter"	Searches for messages where peter does not
					appear in the name.
					Is equal to: search from%"~peter"
search from="peter"		Searches for messages where the name is
					peter.

= equals
< less than
> greater than
% not equal

A less than or greater than match is not possible in all cases.
Example: search orig<"2:0/0.0" does not work.
